Analysis of CPU job scheduling algorithm.

**fcfs.sh**
First come first served algorithm.
i
It may be assumed all procs occur at zero time, but in certain order.
It may be possible to change the number of procs and their CPU burst time.
Process number: 1..6
CPU burst time: 1..50

Must be calculated:
1. Each proc waiting time.
2. Average waiting time.
3. Each proc turnover time.
4. Average turnover time.

**sjf.sh**
Shortest job first algorithm.

It may be assumed all procs occur at zero time, but in certain order.
It may be possible to change the number of procs and their CPU burst time.
Process number: 2..7
CPU burst time: 1..40

Must be calculated:
1. Each proc waiting time.
2. Average waiting time.
3. Each proc turnover time.
4. Average turnover time.
